# ProtoBop Hackathon Demo Script (3 Minutes)

## Roles
- Speaker 1: Frank
- Speaker 2: Yasser

## 0:00-0:15 | Landing Page
**On screen:** Landing/login page with "Continue with Google"

**Speaker 1:**  
"Welcome to ProtoBop - a fast way to turn raw ideas and references into editable web experiences."

**Speaker 2:**  
"We'll show both creation paths in under three minutes: Inspire first, then Translate."

---

## 0:15-0:30 | Home Dashboard
**On screen:** Enter app, show Home with Inspire + Translate cards and recent projects

**Speaker 1:**  
"This is the home dashboard. From here, we see our recent projects, weekly summary and we can start new projects in two modes depending on where the project begins."

**Speaker 2:**  
"If we start with concept and style direction, we use Inspire. If we already have reference imagery, we use Translate. Let's start with the Inspire work-flow"

---

## 0:30-1:55 | Inspire Workflow
**On screen:** Click Start Inspire

**Speaker 1:**  
"Step one is Project Description. We answer guided prompts: category, audience, core value, hero focus, and conversion goal."

**Speaker 2:**  
"That gives us a structured brief instantly, so the system can generate smarter creative options."

**On screen:** Style step, browse style ideas/palettes/fonts, select one

**Speaker 1:**  
"Step two is Style. We compare visual directions, tune palette and typography, then lock the one we want."

**On screen:** Project Tree step with node graph

**Speaker 2:**  
"Step three is Project Tree. We get a node-based structure and choose exactly where to generate from."

**On screen:** Generate previews, select best preview

**Speaker 1:**  
"Step four is Previews. We generate multiple options and pick the strongest route."

**On screen:** Inspire Workspace brush + comment + apply changes + convert to HTML + open editor

**Speaker 2:**  
"Step five is Workspace editing. We can mask specific areas, describe the change, apply it, then convert to HTML."

**Speaker 1:**  
"And once approved, we open it in the iteration editor and code editor for full control."

## 1:55-2:55 | Translate Workflow
**On screen:** Switch to Translate flow

**Speaker 2:**  
"Now Translate workflow. This is image-first."

**On screen:** Upload image + fill title/name/details + Generate

**Speaker 1:**  
"We upload a reference image, add a concise brief, and ProtoBop generates a site structure from that visual input."

**On screen:** Website structure nodes, select node, generate previews, open result

**Speaker 2:**  
"Then we pick a node, generate targeted previews, and open the best result for editing."

**On screen:** Quick pass through visual editor + code editor

**Speaker 1:**  
"From there, it's the same polished editing surface - visual iteration plus direct code access."

---

## 2:55-3:05 | Close
**On screen:** Return to home showing both workflows

**Speaker 2:**   
"ProtoBop gives us two fast paths to the same outcome: production-ready, editable output."

**Speaker 1:**  
"Inspire for idea-first projects. Translate for reference-first projects. That's the power of ProtoBop."
