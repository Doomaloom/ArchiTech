- Follow SOLID Conventions.
- Keep hooks small and focused.
- A single hook should have one clear responsibility.
- Hooks should not exceed ~100 lines unless strongly justified.
- Split large hooks into smaller composable hooks.
- Avoid “god hooks” that manage multiple unrelated concerns.
- Prefer composition over condition-heavy hooks.
