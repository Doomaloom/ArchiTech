- Follow SOLID Conventions.
- Keep hooks small and focused.
- A single hook should have one clear responsibility.
- Hooks should not exceed ~100 lines unless strongly justified.
- Split large hooks into smaller composable hooks.
- Avoid “god hooks” that manage multiple unrelated concerns.
- Prefer composition over condition-heavy hooks.


For Iteration Features:
- When introducing a new feature or adapting an existing one, refactor the code to ensure it follows clean and SOLID coding conventions to keep the codebase neat and understandable. Always open for extension.
